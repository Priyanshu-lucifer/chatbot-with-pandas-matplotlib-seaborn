# 🤖 Chatbot using Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn

This project demonstrates a **simple chatbot** implemented in Python using:
- **Pandas** for data handling
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization

It is built as part of the **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Lab** coursework using Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook.
